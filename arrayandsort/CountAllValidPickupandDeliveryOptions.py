"""
Given n orders, each order consist in pickup and delivery services.

    Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that delivery(i) is always after of pickup(i).

    Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.



    Example 1:

    Input: n = 1
    Output: 1
    Explanation: Unique order (P1, D1), Delivery 1 always is after of Pickup 1.
    Example 2:

    Input: n = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: All possible orders:
    (P1,P2,D1,D2), (P1,P2,D2,D1), (P1,D1,P2,D2), (P2,P1,D1,D2), (P2,P1,D2,D1) and (P2,D2,P1,D1).
    This is an invalid order (P1,D2,P2,D1) because Pickup 2 is after of Delivery 2.
    Example 3:

    Input: n = 3
    Output: 90


    Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 500
    Hint: Use the permutation and combination theory to add one (P, D) pair each time until n pairs.

    Explanation: 如果不考虑Dn必须在Pn之后的话，那么有n对PD的排列组合数量为(2n)的阶乘，当PnDn成对出现，Dn出现在Pn前的概率为1/2，所以要剔除这种情况
    If it is not considered that Dn must be after Pn, then the number of n pairs of PD permutations and combinations is the factorial of (2n).
