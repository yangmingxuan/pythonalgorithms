"""
Given a balanced parentheses string s, return the score of the string.

The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:

"()" has score 1.
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.


Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: s = "(())"
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: s = "()()"
Output: 2


Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 50
s consists of only '(' and ')'.
s is a balanced parentheses string.

     * Explanation: 其实问题的本质是看最终的()处在第几层，举例说明：如果在第一层()是1--2的0次方，如果是在第二层是2--2^1, 第三层是4--2^2，
     *          所以最终问题是计算各个最核心的()之和
     * In fact, the essence of the problem is to see which layer the final () is in. For example: if the first layer () is 1--2 to the 0th power, if it is in the second layer, it is 2--2^1, The third layer is 4--2^2,
     * So the final problem is to calculate the sum of each core ()
